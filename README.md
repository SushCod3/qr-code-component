### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned that using 100vh will select the 100% of the viewport and it enabled me to center the element on the page along with flexbox.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

```
